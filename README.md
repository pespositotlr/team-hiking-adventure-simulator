Originally a coding test to demonstrate the following:

Strategy(s) - there are several ways to solve the problem, you can provide more than one. The goal is to show us how you think.

Architecture and design - we want to see how well you architect and design solutions to complex problems.

Testing - we want to see how you approach testing of the solution.

Standards and best practices.

Explanation - as a C# thought leader in the organization you will be working with and mentoring other engineers. How well you can describe and explain your solution is very important.
